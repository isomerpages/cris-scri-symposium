<h4><strong>Clinical Trials Symposium</strong></h4>
<p>The Clinical Trials Symposium 2024 aims to showcase growth and opportunities of clinical trials in Singapore. Organised by the Singapore Clinical Research Institute, the two-day symposium will gather local and regional leaders from the pharmaceutical industry, academic and healthcare leaders, patient advocates and regulatory organisations. This event takes a holistic approach to discuss about importance of health economic outcome research, real-world data in complementing the traditional clinical development information, and future digitialisation of clinical trial conduct.</p>

<p>The Symposium will also feature the launch of Clinical Trial Singapore (CTSG), a national online portal for clinical trials. Targeted for research volunteers, clinicians, and industry sponsors, CTSG serves as a single point of access to information about ongoing trials and medical experts. It also provides a searchable tissue repository catalogue to foster translational research in Singapore.</p>
