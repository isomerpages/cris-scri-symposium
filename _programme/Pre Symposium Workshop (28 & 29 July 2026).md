<h4><strong>Pre-symposium Workshop on Advanced and Innovative Clinical Trial Designs</strong></h4>
<p>This workshop, titled A<strong>dvanced and Innovative Clinical Trial Designs</strong>,
provides a comprehensive and practice-oriented introduction to the evolving
landscape of clinical research methodology. With a specific focus on moving
beyond traditional randomized controlled trials, this course explores advanced
and adaptive strategies designed to improve trial efficiency, ethical standards,
and statistical power.</p>
<p>Designed as a pre-symposium short course for the <strong>Clinical Trial Symposium Singapore 2026</strong>,
the workshop aims to strengthen participants’ understanding of the entire
research lifecycle from the logic of early-phase dose-finding to the intricacies
of late-stage cluster and stepped-wedge designs. Participants will gain
up-to-date insights into precision medicine trials and the integration
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in research. The curriculum is structured
to bridge the gap between theoretical statistical concepts and practical
application in real-world clinical settings.</p>
<p>The course is tailored for:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Clinical Researchers and Investigators seeking to expand their portfolio
with more efficient, adaptive, or patient-centric trial designs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biostatisticians and Data Scientists wishing to update their methodological
toolkit with a variety of techniques in sample size estimation, interim
analysis, and AI applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pharmaceutical and Biotech Professionals engaged in drug development who
need to optimize early-phase strategies (First-in-human, Phase I) and precision
trial designs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulatory and Review Board Members who want to appreciate the scientific
validity and ethical considerations of innovative, non-traditional trial
designs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The workshop is best suited for individuals with basic knowledge of clinical
trial principles, fundamental biostatistics, and an interest in the practical
implementation of novel research methodologies.</p>
